<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>We wanted to be able to sell our cards without having to go to the local card 
shop, and figured other people might want the same thing.

<h4>Why doesn't feature X work?</h4>
<p>Tomescour needs javascript and in some places HTML 5. Enabling javascript and
updating your browser update will probably take care of any issues with the site. 
If you're using Internet Explorer, it's still the #1 browser for downloading a 
better browser.
